        <p>
            The objective of the game is to guess the 4 digit number selected by the computer.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The player gets 7 turns to guess the orrect number.
            Each guess made by the player is evaluated and the number or bulls or cows is displayed.
            By the number of bulls and cows a player should be able to guess the correct number
            after a few attempts.
            Each digit can have the value ranging from 0-9 and no digit is repeated in the number.
        </p>

        <p>
            A bull indicates that the digit guessed by the player is correct and
            in the correct position comparing with the computer generated number.
            Whereas a cow indicates that the digit guessed by the player is correct
            but not in the correct position comparing with the computer generated number.

            For instance the generated number is 2854
            Player guesses the number as 5836

            This would result in Bulls - 1 and Cows - 1
            Since the digit 8 is correct and also in the correct position this gives a bulls score.
            Since the digit 5 is correct but is not in the correct position this gives a cows score.

            Lets look at the score of a different guess for even more clarity.

            Player guesses the number 4853

            Since the digits 8 and 5 are now in correct position this gives Bulls - 2
            Since the digit 4 is correct but not yet in the correct position this gives Cows - 1
