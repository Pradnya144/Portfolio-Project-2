        <p>
            The objective of the game is to guess the 4 digit number selected by the computer.
        </p>
        <br>
    
        <p>
            The player gets <em><b>7 turns</b></em> to guess the orrect number.
            Each guess made by the player is evaluated and the number or bulls or cows is displayed.
            By the number of bulls and cows a player should be able to guess the correct number
            after a few attempts.
            Each digit can have the value ranging from <em><b>0-9 and no digit is repeated</b></em> in the number.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            A bull indicates that the digit guessed by the player is correct and
            in the correct position comparing with the computer generated number.
            Whereas a cow indicates that the digit guessed by the player is correct
            but not in the correct position comparing with the computer generated number.
            <br><br>

            For instance the generated number is <b>2854</b><br>
            Player guesses the number as <b>5836</b>
            <br>

            This would result in <b>Bulls - 1 and Cows - 1 </b><br><br>
            Since the digit 8 is correct and also in the correct position this gives a bulls score.
            Since the digit 5 is correct but is not in the correct position this gives a cows score.
            <br>
            Lets look at the score of a different guess for even more clarity.
            <br><br>
            Player guesses the number <b>4853</b>
            <br>
            This would result in <b>Bulls - 2 and Cows - 1 </b><br><br>
            Since the digits 8 and 5 are now in correct position this gives Bulls - 2
            Since the digit 4 is correct but not yet in the correct position this gives Cows - 1
