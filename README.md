## User Experience (UX)  

### User Story  

User stories were created to help guide the design and implementation phases of the project and to ensure the needs of each stake holder are undestood.  

* New Player Goals  
   * As a new player:  
     * I want to understand the rules and how to play the game.  
     * I want the interface to be simple and easy to navigate.  

* Seasoned Player Goals  
   * As a player who has played this game before:  
     * I want to be able to directly start playing the game.  
     * I want to interface to be simple and clear as should be for a logical game.  


### Structure

The game interface consists of 2 pages.

* A landing page or the main game page having the main game area where user enters inputs and sees reults, a timer and winstreak. Also a tab to view the instructions.  
* An instructions page having the rules of the game with examples.  

### Future Advancements  

More difficulty levels and complexities can be added to the game play, challenging the player even more.   
More setting options and personilization for player can be added to the game.  


## Design

### Colour  

Considering this being a logical game, I have kept the colour scheme quite neutral. I have chosen shades of green to keep the website soothing on the eyes. I have chosen shades of green off different palettes that I think would go together.  
I have used https://coolors.co/ to generate the palette.

### Font  



### Wireframe  

I have used a basic microsoft word document to create a mock up for the game layout.  The mock up helped in designing the layout of the webpage and colour theme.
